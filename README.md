# Spectral_Biclustering_algorithm

We're going to play with a special kind of pattern called a checkerboard. We'll make a grid with squares, and some squares will be black and others white, like a checkerboard.
Then, we're going to use a fancy tool called the SpectralBiclustering algorithm. This tool helps us organize the squares in a clever way. It doesn't just look at each row or column by itself; it looks at both rows and columns together. This way, it can find groups of squares that have similar patterns.
Imagine you're playing a matching game. You have cards with pictures on both sides, and you're trying to find pairs. But instead of just matching cards randomly, you try to find patterns in how the pictures are arranged on the cards.
After we run the algorithm, it will organize the squares into groups that have similar patterns. This is helpful for data where things need to be in a certain order, like pictures, sequences of events, or genetic information.
Finally, we'll rearrange the squares based on the groups the algorithm found. It's like putting all the black squares together and all the white squares together, so we can see the patterns more clearly.
